## Summary

DigitalOcean is a cloud computing platform built for developers and businesses who want a simple way to deploy & manage their infrastructure. This is a KEP proposing DigitalOcean as a cloud provider within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

## Motivation

### Goals

* Supporting DigitalOcean within the Kubernetes ecosystem. This involves:
  * providing an open community to promote discussions for Kubernetes on DigitalOcean

## Prerequisites
