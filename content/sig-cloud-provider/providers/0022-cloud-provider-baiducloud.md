## Summary

Baidu is a gold member of CNCF and we have a large team working on Kubernetes and related projects like complex scheduling, heterogeneous computing, auto-scaling etc. We build cloud platform to support Baidu emerging business including autonomous driving, deep learning, blockchain by leveraging Kubernetes. We also provide public container services named cloud container engine(CCE).

## Motivation

### Goals

- Designing, discussing, and maintaining the cloud-provider-baidu repository under Github Kubernetes project.

### Non-Goals

- Identify domain knowledge and work that can be contributed back to Kubernetes and related CNCF projects.

- Mentor CCE and BPC developers to contribute to CNCF projects.

- Focus on Kubernetes and CNCF related projects, the discussion of development issue for CCE and BCP will not be included in the SIG.
